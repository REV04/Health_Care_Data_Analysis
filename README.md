# Health Care Data Analysis
This project, "Health Care Data Analysis," is part of my Hacktiv8 coursework on regression. It serves as both a requirement for my Hacktiv8 studies and a component of my personal portfolio in Data Analyst. I created this project with a fictional background, made solely for the purpose of the project. You can find my other personal projects on [Richard Edgina Virgo](https://github.com/REV04).

#### -- Project Status: Finished

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to analyze and evaluate healthcare data retrieved from the Kaggle website. The dataset includes patients' personal information along with hospital and treatment costs. The project aims to analyze the correlation between variables in the healthcare dataset, perform descriptive and inferential statistical tests, examine relationships between variables using Chi-Square and Pearson tests, and visualize the findings using Tableau.

### Methods Used
- DQL
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
### Technologies
- SQL
- Python
- Tableau
## Project Description

The dataset I analyzed is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about healthcare. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation checks to understand the data better. Following the EDA, I created visualizations using Tableau.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), analysis, and summary are being kept in Python/Health_Care_Data_Analysis
